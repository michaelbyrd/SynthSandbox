== SynthSandbox

SynthSandbox is a creative environment built on top of the javascript timbre.js

I was inspired by websites like CodePen.io and Codecademy to create a place for programmers to try out a language.  Audio synthesis programming languages aren't hugely popular so I wanted a place to get more people interested, whether they are musicians or programmers.

It is deployed at http://synthsandbox.herokuapp.com/
